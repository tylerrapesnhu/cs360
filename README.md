#Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address? 
#-This app was created to be a simple daily weight tracking app. It allows the user to create an account, set a goal weight, and log daily weights. The user is also able to update their weight chart through CRUD functionality
#What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
#-The main screens that were needed were a login/register screen, a weight table, and a setting goal weight screen. I would say my UI designs were successful because I focused on creating a userfriendly app that is easy to navigate and is clearly labeled. 
#How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
#-I mainly started with designing the user interface screens and then worked backwards from there. I wanted to figure out the layout of the screen and add the functionality to manage those screens after. 
#How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
#-After running the code and fixing any errors present, I ran the app on the simulator. I used Logcat to figure out what was going on each time the app would crash. This helped me navigate what I could do to make the app better. Originally I was creating two databases for the users and for the weights. I figured out that I could do two tables within one database and that helped the app out greatly. 
#Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
#-I had to innovate my own design by creating one database. I initially thought I would need two. That meant that I had to rewrite the database helpers but it was worth it so that the app would not crash. 
#In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
#-I am particularly proud of the user interface on the weight's screen. I find the design simple but sleek. I am proud of my work and what I have learned through creating the app.
